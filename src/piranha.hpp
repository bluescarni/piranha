/** \file piranha.hpp
 * \brief Global piranha header file.
 * 
 * Include this file to import piranha's entire public interface.

/// Root piranha namespace.
/**
 * \todo implement is_instance_of when GCC support for variadic templates improves, and remove the tag structs
 * (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4749863/variadic-templates-and-copy-construction-via-assignment) ->
 * keep in mind in some cases the tags are actually used for discriminating between types, adjust it accordingly (e.g., power series).
 * \todo switch to auto -> decltype declarations of member functions for complicated types (e.g., tuples) when decltype on this
 * becomes available.
 * \todo explain in general section the base assumptions of move semantics and thread safety (e.g., require implicitly that
 * all moved-from objects are assignable and destructable, and everything not thread-safe by default).
 * \todo document classes in detail:: namespace used to implement mathematical functions?
 * \todo fix type traits such as is_nothrow_move_constructible/assignable. They must work also for references,
 * make them use SFINAE, declval and decltype as in the current GCC 4.6 type_traits header (e.g., see is_constructible). Keep in mind
 * reference collapsing rules, etc. etc.
 * \todo modify concepts to use declval where applicable, instead of dereferencing nullptr.
 * \todo base_series test: missing merge terms with negative+move (that actually swaps the contents of the series) and negative+move with different series types.
 * \todo concepts: how to deal with generic methods (e.g., coefficient in-place multiply by whatever)? We could add another parameter to the concept, with default void,
 * and use it explictly only when actually using that generic method? ADDENDUM: connected to this, the question of dealing with methods that
 * have additional type requirements wrt those delcared in class. Probably need to review all generic methods and add type requirements there.
 * \todo hashing of array_key based on kronecker substitution -> use static table of kronecker_array to encode the array key in an integer -> note that this becomes
 * moot in case the homomorphic hashing thing works out.
 * \todo assert that concepts are respected in models.
 * \todo check the series concept: where is it used?
 * \todo check wherever use use std::vector as class member that we implement copy assignment with copy+move. There is no guarantee that copy operator=() on vector
 * (or standard containers) has strong exception safety guarantee.
 * \todo check usage of max_load_factor (especially wrt flukes in * instead of / or viceversa).
 * \todo review use of numeric_cast: in some places we might be using it in such a way we expect errors if converting floating point to int, but this is not the case (from the doc)
 * \todo the tuning parameters should be tested and justified (e.g., when to go into mt mode, etc.).
 * \todo probably we should make overflow-safe all operations on keys that currently are not: multiplication, computation of degree (including in truncators), etc.
 * and then optimize instead in the multipliers (by checking the ranges before performing the multiplication) -> this probably becomes null in case the caching of degree
 * values in the truncators turns out to work ok.
 * \todo think of new way of interoperate between composite types (e.g., complex and series) vs non-composite types. I.e., allow complex<T> + U
 * only if T + U produces T.
 * \todo start experimenting with parallel sort in multipliers and truncators (e.g., for the rectangular benchmark).
 * \todo forbid interoperability in +-* between series with different keys?
 * \todo interface to query degree should be the same across power series and truncator: should add missing overload in power series to query partial degree of a single symbol,
 * and maybe replace in the high level interface the std::set of string with initializer list, as it seems sometimes {"a","b"} is not picked up as std::set of string.
 * \todo look into perfect forwarding of members, for use in series, hash set (?) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8570655/perfect-forwarding-a-member-of-object
 * \todo look into forwarding and delegating constructors when they become available.
